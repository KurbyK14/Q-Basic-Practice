# Q-Basic-Practice
Using QB64 for Windows 10

Hi, my name is Jake and I have been having trouble with this one particular exercise for coding in QB64 or QBasic. I can't seem to figure out what exactly is making the code not output every single DATA input, it only outputs a few when I run it. If anyone could help that would be much appreciated! Thanks
